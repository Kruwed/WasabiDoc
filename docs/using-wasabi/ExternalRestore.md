# Restoring Wasabi Wallet in Other Wallets

:::danger Potential privacy leak!
If you do not run your own node or your own Electrum server, you will leak all your addresses to random third-party servers, losing anonymity against those entities, so you must make a judgement call by being aware of this.

You should set up Tor on Network preferences, connect to your own node or install your own Electrum server (if the wallet supports it) via [Electrum Personal Server](https://github.com/chris-belcher/electrum-personal-server), [ElectrumX](https://github.com/kyuupichan/electrumx) or [Electrs](https://github.com/romanz/electrs).
