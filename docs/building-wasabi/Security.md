# Security Policy

If a vulnerability does not compromise users' privacy or security, open a [regular GitHub issue](https://github.com/WalletWasabi/WalletWasabi/issues/new/choose).
If it does, then take great care with responsible disclosure by reporting a [vulnerability on GitHub](https://github.com/WalletWasabi/WalletWasabi/security/advisories/new).
